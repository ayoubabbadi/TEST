<h1 align="center"> Advanced Front-End Portfolio Challenge</h1>

Welcome, developer! This repository isn't just code; it's a high-level test of your front-end skills. Your mission is to build a modern, fully-interactive, and responsive portfolio website from scratch, guided *only* by the screenshot below.

This challenge will test your mastery of HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript, forcing you to think about architecture, responsiveness, and user experience.

##  The Challenge

* **Goal:** Recreate the portfolio website shown in the screenshot.
* **Source:** You must work *only* from the target design. Do not look at the solution code!
* **Structure:** You *must* separate your code into three distinct files:
    1.  `index.html` (for semantic structure)
    2.  `style.css` (for all styling)
    3.  `script.js` (for all interactivity)

---

##  The Target Design

Your build must be a pixel-perfect match of the design below, including both **desktop** and **mobile** layouts.

##  Core Features Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your final product is fully functional.

###  UI/UX & Design
* [ ] **Responsive Design:** The site must look perfect on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
* [ ] **Dark/Light Mode:** A theme-toggle button that switches the color palette.
* [ ] **Mobile Navigation:** A "hamburger" menu that slides in on mobile.
* [ ] **"Back to Top" Button:** A button that appears on scroll and smoothly returns the user to the top.
* [ ] **Hover & Focus States:** All interactive elements (links, buttons, cards) must have clear hover and focus states.
* [ ] **Form Validation:** The contact form must show visual error messages for invalid inputs.

###  Interactive Functionality
* [ ] **Typing Effect:** The homepage heading ("I am a...") must have an animated typing/deleting effect.
* [ ] **Animated Counters:** The "About Me" stats (e.g., "4 Years Experience") and "Skill" percentages must count up from 0 when they scroll into view.
* [ ] **Scroll Animations:** All page sections must fade in or slide in as they are scrolled to (using `IntersectionObserver`).
* [ ] **Active Nav Link:** The current section's link in the sidebar must automatically highlight.
* [ ] **Portfolio Filtering:** The portfolio items must filter with a smooth animation.
* [ ] **Form Loading State:** The "Send" button must show a spinner and be disabled while "submitting".
* [ ] **Toast Notifications:** The form must show a success/error message (no `alert()`!).

##  Technology Stack

This challenge is built with the fundamentals of the web. No frameworks allowed!

* **HTML5:** For semantic markup and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** For modern layouts (Flexbox, Grid), variables, and animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity (DOM manipulation, `IntersectionObserver`, `localStorage`, Event Listeners).
